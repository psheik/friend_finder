Friend Finder is an application using mysql, node, and express that determines the user's most compatible friend using the following as a guide:

It compares the differences between the person's score and other people's scores using a survey, finding the smallest differences as possible friendships. Once a match is found, the current user's most compatible friend will display the result(s) on the page showing the name and picture of the most compatible friend.
